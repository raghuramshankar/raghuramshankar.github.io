      <description>I work at Elysia Battery Intelligence, where I develop high-fidelity physics-based and data-driven battery models for applications in motorsports, automotive and the mining industry. I also validate these models using MIL environments and automate the process using CI pipelines.
Outside of work, I have an avid interest in risk management, portfolio construction and following the stock market. I also enjoy automating tasks and some light data analytics using Python.</description>
